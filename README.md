# 2E10_buggy_code
some of the code I wrote for the 2E10 buggy project at TCD

the Bronze challenge involved the buggy following a white line/track with ir sensors as its "eyes" and stopping if  the  ultrasonic sensor detected an obstacle

The Silver challenge involved using the PIXY camera to have the buggy navigate its way through two differently coloured posts and roughly stream what it was "seeing" to a processing display
through the Xbee( covid happened, not entirely finished)
